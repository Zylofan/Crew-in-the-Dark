[head=3]ROLLING DICE[/head]

When you take action roll an action. The number of pips an action has is how many dice you roll. Your result is the highest value rolled.

1-3: You Fail, bad things happen to you.
4-5: You succeed, but bad things happen to you
6: You succeed, no bad things happen to you.

If you have 0 pips, then you roll 2 dice and take the lowest result, instead of the highest.
